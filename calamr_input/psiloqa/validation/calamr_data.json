Only Shimaore is represented on the local television news program by Mayotte La Premire.  The 2002 census references 80,140 speakers of Shimaore in Mayotte itself, to which one would have to add people living outside the island, mostly in metropolitan France.  There are also 20,000 speakers of Comorian in Madagascar, of which 3,000 are Shimaore speakers.\nThe same 2002 census indicates that 37,840 persons responded as knowing how to read or write Shimaore.  However this number has to be taken with caution, since it was a few years after this census was taken that a standard writing system was introduced.\nFrom a sociolinguistic perspective, French tends to be regarded by many Shimaore speakers as the language of higher education and prestige, and there is a temptation by native Mahorans to provide an all-French education to their children.  This puts a lot of pressure on Shimaore and the language may become endangered in the near future if nothing is done.\nAlthough French remains the official language in Mayotte, Shimaore will probably be taught in Mahoran schools starting in the next few years, and a pilot project began in fall 2004.  As in many parts of France where local languages are introduced in the school system, this has led to tensions between partisans of a French-centered education system and administrations, versus those promoting a more diversified approach.  Shimaore's position in this regard is however different from other French regions (such as Brittany), since the language is locally spoken by a majority of the population.

    "summary": "An empress in fairy chess is a special piece that represents the queen in traditional chess. In fairy chess, empresses are considered the strongest and most powerful pieces, as they can move two spaces forward and backward, as well as diagonally. They can also capture other pieces, including bishops, rooks, and knights, and can be used to create a strong defensive line. In traditional chess, empresses can move one space forward and two space backward, as well as diagonally, and can also capture other pieces. The move and capture rules are slightly different in fairy chess, but the basic concept of capturing is the same. Overall, while empresses in traditional chess can be powerful pieces, they are not as strategically valuable in fairy chess as they are in traditional chess."

The series has been divided into two sub-series, known as the Bhaalspawn Saga and the Dark Alliance, both taking place mostly within the Western Heartlands, but the Bhaalspawn Saga extends to Amn and Tethyr. The Dark Alliance series was released for consoles and was critically and commercially successful. The Bhaalspawn Saga was critically acclaimed for using pausable realtime gameplay, which is credited with revitalizing the computer role-playing game (CRPG) genre.\nThe Bhaalspawn Saga was originally developed by BioWare for personal computers. Beamdog and its division Overhaul Games developed remakes of the original games in HD. The Dark Alliance series was originally set to be developed by Snowblind Studios, but ports were handled by Black Isle Studios, High Voltage Software, and Magic Pockets, with the second game developed by Black Isle.\nBlack Isle Studios had planned a third series to be set in the Dalelands and be a PC-exclusive hack and slash game with pausable real-time gameplay. The game would not have been connected to the Bhaalspawn Saga series. The game was cancelled when Interplay forfeited the D&D PC license to Atari.\nThe series was revived in 2012 with Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition, an update of the original Baldur's Gate using an enhanced Infinity Engine. The release of the Enhanced Edition marked the first release in the series in eight years, and was followed by an enhanced edition of the second Baldur's Gate called Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition. Beamdog was granted permission to develop new games with the license, such as Baldur's Gate: Siege of Dragonspear, an expansion for Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition.

    "body": "Baldur's Gate is a series of role-playing video games set in the Forgotten Realms Dungeons & Dragons campaign setting. The series has been divided into two sub-series, known as the Bhaalspawn Saga and the Dark Alliance, both taking place mostly within the Western Heartlands, but the Bhaalspawn Saga extends to Amn and Tethyr. The Dark Alliance series was released for consoles and was critically and commercially successful. The Bhaalspawn Saga was critically acclaimed for using pausable realtime gameplay, which is credited with revitalizing the computer role-playing game (CRPG) genre.\nThe Bhaalspawn Saga was originally developed by BioWare for personal computers. Beamdog and its division Overhaul Games developed remakes of the original games in HD. The Dark Alliance series was originally set to be developed by Snowblind Studios, but ports were handled by Black Isle Studios, High Voltage Software, and Magic Pockets, with the second game developed by Black Isle.\nBlack Isle Studios had planned a third series to be set in the Dalelands and be a PC-exclusive hack and slash game with pausable real-time gameplay. The game would not have been connected to the Bhaalspawn Saga series. The game was cancelled when Interplay forfeited the D&D PC license to Atari.\nThe series was revived in 2012 with Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition, an update of the original Baldur's Gate using an enhanced Infinity Engine. The release of the Enhanced Edition marked the first release in the series in eight years, and was followed by an enhanced edition of the second Baldur's Gate called Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition. Beamdog was granted permission to develop new games with the license, such as Baldur's Gate: Siege of Dragonspear, an expansion for Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition. The license was later given to Larian Studios, who developed and published Baldur's Gate 3, released in 2023.",
    "summary": "The development and release of Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition in 2012 had a significant impact on the series' progression. It marked a significant milestone in the Baldur's Gate series, as it was the first time the game was available on multiple platforms, including PC, Mac, and Linux.\n\nThe Enhanced Edition featured high-quality graphics, improved sound effects, and voice acting, as well as a number of enhancements to the game's gameplay mechanics, such as new quests, weapons, and skills. The Enhanced Edition also introduced a new playable race, the Night Elf, and a new playable class, the Fighter.\n\nThe Enhanced Edition was a commercial and critical success, with the game selling well on PC and being nominated for several awards. The Enhanced Edition also helped to boost the series' popularity and established a new fan base for the franchise.\n\nOverall, the Enhanced Edition's success helped to further cement the series' legacy and established a new standard for the Baldur's Gate franchise, with the release of Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn in 2014"

The ICAO format has already been in use for all domestic flight plans in Canada, Mexico and many other countries for a number of years.\nRegardless of the form used, air traffic controllers (ATC) issue clearances based on filed equipment codes, therefore it is important for pilots to use the appropriate coding. For example, if a desired route requires GPS, then the pilot should file /G, even if the aircraft also qualifies for other suffixes (this may be moot due to new RNAV routing requirements to use the ICAO form & codes). Pilots are recommended to file the maximum capability of their aircraft in the equipment suffix.\nTo see the differences in the coding systems, consider a VFR aircraft with a VHF communication radio, VOR receiver with glideslope for ILS approaches, ADF, a GPS and a pressure altitude reporting transponder.

This success not only set a precedent for the legitimacy of using such a defense strategy but also suggested to other defense lawyers that similar tactics might be effective in future cases.

    "summary": "The four axes that define the role of women in media are:\n\n1. **Representation**: This refers to the number and variety of women characters in media, their roles, and the impact they have on the story. Women should not only be present but also have significant roles and influence in the narrative.\n\n2. **Objectification**: This refers to the degree to which women characters are portrayed as objects of desire or as mere physical attributes rather than as fully developed human beings. This can include their appearance, body language, and the way they are treated by other characters.\n\n3. **Power Dynamics**: This refers to the way women characters interact with men characters and the power dynamics at play in these interactions. Women should not be relegated to passive roles or be subjected to abuse or harassment.\n\n4. **Gender Stereotypes**: This refers to the way women characters are portrayed in terms of their gender roles and expectations. Women should not be portrayed as only being capable of certain tasks or having certain traits. They should be able to have a range of abilities and traits, just like men."

It involves recognizing and reflecting on one's own strengths, weaknesses, and values, as well as the impact of these factors on their behavior and relationships.\n\nSelf-assessment is a crucial aspect of social cognition, as it enables individuals to make informed decisions, adjust their behavior, and maintain a sense of self-awareness. It involves a combination of cognitive, emotional, and social factors, including self-referential thinking, self-monitoring, and self-reflection.\n\nSelf-assessment is often contrasted with self-perception, which refers to the process of attributing one's own behavior or attitudes to internal dispositions or characteristics. Self-assessment, on the other hand, involves attributing one's own behavior or attitudes to external factors, such as others' opinions or circumstances.\n\nSelf-assessment is also closely related to self-efficacy, which refers to an individual's confidence in their ability to achieve a particular goal or outcome. Self-assessment plays a significant role in shaping self-efficacy, as it influences an individual's perceptions of their own abilities and competence.\n\nOverall, self-assessment is a fundamental aspect of social psychology, as it enables individuals to understand and manage their own mental states, make informed decisions, and maintain a sense of self-awareness and self-control."

    "summary": "The outcome of the 2009 South African general election had a significant impact on Jacob Zuma's presidency. Zuma's African National Congress (ANC) party won a majority of seats in parliament, giving him the mandate to become the country's fourth post-apartheid president. This victory provided Zuma with a strong political base and allowed him to consolidate his power within the party.\n\nZuma's tenure as president was marked by several significant milestones:\n\n1. Cabinet reshuffle: In March 2017, Zuma announced a major cabinet reshuffle, which saw the dismissal of several high-profile ministers, including finance minister Pravin Gordhan. The move was widely criticized by the business community, opposition parties, and some ANC members, who accused Zuma of undermining economic stability and democracy.\n\n2. State capture scandal: In 2016, allegations of state capture by the Gupta family, a wealthy Indian-South African family with close ties to Zuma, surfaced. The scandal involved allegations of corruption, influence-peddling, and the misuse of state resources. The scandal led to several high-profile investigations, including the establishment of a judicial commission of inquiry to investigate the allegations.\n\n3. Economic challenges: Zuma's presidency was marked by significant economic challenges, including high unemployment, inequality, and poverty. The country's economic growth rate has been sluggish, and the country has been downgraded to junk status by major credit rating agencies.\n\n4. Political turmoil: Zuma's presidency was also marked by political turmoil, including internal party divisions, leadership challenges, and factionalism. These divisions have threatened the cohesion and stability of the ANC, which has been the dominant force in South African politics since the end of apartheid.\n\n5. Land reform: One of Zuma's key priorities has been land reform, which has been a contentious issue in South African politics. The ANC has long committed itself to land redistribution as a means of redressing the injustices of apartheid, but the implementation of land reform has been slow and fraught with challenges, including legal and constitutional obstacles.\n\nIn summary, Zuma's presidency has been marked by a mix of achievements"

    "summary": "The species known as stream glory, scientifically named Helontium sparsipilum, belongs to the family Convolvulaceae, which includes over 1,000 species of annual and perennial plants commonly known as morning glories. This classification holds significant importance regarding the stream glory's characteristics as it indicates that it is a type of vine plant with tubular flowers that bloom in the morning and close in the afternoon. The stream glory specifically prefers to grow in fast-moving streams and rivers, and its classification in the Convolvulaceae family highlights its adaptations to survive in wet environments, such as its creeping, rooting stem that allows it to anchor itself to the streambed and its ability to tolerate frequent flooding. Additionally, its classification within this family implies that it shares similarities in structure and function with other members of Convolvulaceae, such as its twining stem, which helps it climb and attach itself to nearby vegetation, and its seed dispersal mechanism, which involves the aid of ants in carrying its seeds away from the parent plant."

    "summary": "The 1977 Rutgers Scarlet Knights football team's status as an independent is significant for several reasons. Being an independent team means that they were not affiliated with any specific conference, which allowed for greater flexibility in scheduling. This independence often enables teams to set up matches against a diverse range of opponents, potentially enhancing their visibility and ability to compete against various styles of play. However, it can also pose challenges, such as a lack of a consistent schedule or the difficulty in achieving a higher ranking in postseason play compared to teams in established conferences. Their ability to compile an 8-3 record as an independent suggests that they successfully managed both the opportunities and challenges that came with this status, ultimately allowing them to outscore their opponents significantly."

Taxonomic classification is important in entomology because it helps scientists understand the relationships between different species, provides a standardized naming system (binomial nomenclature), and assists in biodiversity conservation efforts by identifying species that may be endangered or at risk.

It consists of a preparation of rice and beans, preferably Brazilian beans such as \"feijo verde\" or \"feijo novo\". It is common to add queijo coalho. Dried meat is not added in Cear. In Paraba and in Pernambuco, there is a variant called rubaco, a dish that is very popular in the Serto.",
    "summary": "Queijo coalho is often added to Baio de dois to enhance its flavor and texture, contributing to the dish's rich and hearty profile. In Cear, the emphasis is on maintaining a pure version of Baio de dois without the inclusion of dried meat, which distinguishes it from preparations in other regions. For instance, in Paraba and Pernambuco, the rubaco variant may include additional ingredients and flavors that reflect local culinary practices. This difference highlights the regional culinary identities within Brazilian cuisine and illustrates how traditional dishes can vary significantly based on locality."

    "summary": "The AufhausenKrhstorf railway historically served as a branch line dedicated to improving regional transport within Lower Bavaria, facilitating connections between various towns and communities in the area. During its operational period, this railway would have contributed to the economic development of the region by enhancing trade routes and making travel more accessible to residents. Over time, the evolution of transportation systems and shifting societal needs likely led to a decline in the railway's usage, reflecting broader trends in transport where road networks and alternative forms of transit became more prominent. Eventually, the discontinuation of the railway line indicates a shift in the logistics and transport dynamics within Lower Bavaria as well as the transformation of Markt Eichendorf into its current administrative state."

The theory hypothesises that the government of any underdeveloped country needs to make large investments in a number of industries simultaneously. This will enlarge the market size, increase productivity, and provide an incentive for the private sector to invest.\nNurkse was in favour of attaining balanced growth in both the industrial and agricultural sectors of the economy. He recognised that the expansion and inter-sectoral balance between agriculture and manufacturing is necessary so that each of these sectors provides a market for the products of the other and in turn, supplies the necessary raw materials for the development and growth of the other.\nNurkse and Paul Rosenstein-Rodan were the pioneers of balanced growth theory and much of how it is understood today dates back to their work.\nNurkse's theory discusses how the poor size of the market in underdeveloped countries perpetuates its underdeveloped state. Nurkse has also clarified the various determinants of the market size and puts primary focus on productivity. According to him, if the productivity levels rise in a less developed country, its market size will expand and thus it can eventually become a developed economy. Apart from this, Nurkse has been nicknamed an export pessimist, as he feels that the finances to make investments in underdeveloped countries must arise from their own domestic territory.

    "summary": "Integrin alpha 2 is a protein that plays a crucial role in the attachment of white blood cells to the inner lining of blood vessels. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), integrin alpha 2 is upregulated on the surface of immune cells, contributing to their infiltration and activation within the intestinal lining. Vatelizumab is a medication that blocks the integrin alpha 2 protein, thereby inhibiting the attachment of white blood cells to the intestinal lining. The drug has shown promising results in treating IBD, but its lack of efficacy in certain patient populations has led to further investigation. The implications of this finding are that integrin alpha 2 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for IBD, and its inhibition may hold therapeutic potential. However, more research is needed to fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms and to determine the optimal patient population for Vatelizumab treatment."

An exception is the \"iron group\", which usually refers to group 8, but in chemistry may also mean iron, cobalt, and nickel, or some other set of elements with similar chemical properties. In astrophysics and nuclear physics, it usually refers to iron, cobalt, nickel, chromium, and manganese.",
    "summary": "The modern numbering system of groups, which includes the use of atomic numbers, significantly affects the classification of elements like hydrogen and helium. In the older naming scheme, these elements were referred to as 'alkali metals' due to their similarity in physical and chemical properties. However, with the introduction of the modern numbering system, they are now classified as Group 8 and 18 elements, respectively. This change in classification reflects the distinct differences in their atomic and physical properties, such as their electronegativity and reactivity."

He played only 7 league games for Hartlepool, before leaving, turning up next at South African side Hellenic. In December 1972 he returned to England, signing for West Bromwich Albion, but left without appearing in their league side.\nHe had a spell with Workington before joining Bath City in July 1973. He made nearly 300 appearances for Bath over the next five years.\nIn August 1978, Allen joined AFC Bournemouth, where he was to make 152 league appearances. In 1983, he signed for Bury on non-contract terms, but failed to make the first team, and in December 1983 he joined Peterborough United, playing only once in the Associate Members' Cup away to Wrexham. Peterborough proved to be an unhappy place for Allen a couple years later when, as a Torquay player, he was attacked on the pitch by Peterborough 'fans'.\nFrom Peterborough, he moved to Sweden, playing for Halmstads BK, before joining Torquay United on a free transfer in March 1984, taking over from John Turner as first choice goalkeeper, making his dbut in a 21 defeat away to Hartlepool United on 17 March.\nIn September 1985, he left Plainmoor to join Swindon Town again on a free transfer. He played 40 league games the following season as Swindon won the Fourth Division title, but early the following season he lost his place to Fraser Digby, only playing a further 5 league games, before being transferred back to Torquay in December 1986 as a replacement for John Smeulders.\nBy now his grey hair and moustache made him instantly recognisable and he helped Torquay to remain in league football, playing in the first great escape when Torquay drew 22 with Crewe Alexandra at Plainmoor thanks to a late equaliser from Paul Dobson and help from the police dog Bryn biting Jim McNichol ensuring that injury time would be required. The following season, he was an ever-present as Cyril Knowles' side made the play-offs, but was released in the summer, joining Bath City in July 1988. He began the season as a regular, but after only nine games, broke his leg while conceding a penalty against Dorchester Town. He regained his fitness, but was released in February 1989.\nHe moved on to recently relegated Newport County, but as Newport folded and failed to complete their Conference season, he returned to Torquay for a third time in April 1989 to cover for the injured Ken Veysey and played at Wembley in the Associate Members' Cup Final as Torquay's only other professional keeper Mark Coombe was cup-tied. He retired from football in June 1989 to work for the Post Office.\nIn May 2001, the Torquay Herald Express reported that Allen was living in Paignton, captaining Chudleigh cricket team and working as an ambulance driver for the South & West Devon Health Authority",
    "summary": "Kenny Allen returned to Torquay United for a third time in April 1989 after the club's first-choice goalkeeper, Ken Veysey, was injured. At this time, Newport County, where he had recently signed, was facing financial issues and ultimately folded, prompting his return. Allen's significance in the Associate Members' Cup Final was paramount, as he played despite other keeper Mark Coombe being cup-tied, meaning he could not participate. This led to Allen taking the field at Wembley, a stage that not many players get to experience, showcasing the importance of having experienced players in critical situations. Allen's return reflected both his resilience in overcoming career setbacks, including injuries and limited opportunities, and his ability to contribute to his team during crucial moments, illustrating the unpredictability of football careers and the vital role of backup players in professional settings."

He played 40 league games the following season as Swindon won the Fourth Division title, but early the following season he lost his place to Fraser Digby, only playing a further 5 league games, before being transferred back to Torquay in December 1986 as a replacement for John Smeulders.\nBy now his grey hair and moustache made him instantly recognisable and he helped Torquay to remain in league football, playing in the first great escape when Torquay drew 22 with Crewe Alexandra at Plainmoor thanks to a late equaliser from Paul Dobson and help from the police dog Bryn biting Jim McNichol ensuring that injury time would be required. The following season, he was an ever-present as Cyril Knowles' side made the play-offs, but was released in the summer, joining Bath City in July 1988. He began the season as a regular, but after only nine games, broke his leg while conceding a penalty against Dorchester Town. He regained his fitness, but was released in February 1989.\nHe moved on to recently relegated Newport County, but as Newport folded and failed to complete their Conference season, he returned to Torquay for a third time in April 1989 to cover for the injured Ken Veysey and played at Wembley in the Associate Members' Cup Final as Torquay's only other professional keeper Mark Coombe was cup-tied. He retired from football in June 1989 to work for the Post Office.\nIn May 2001, the Torquay Herald Express reported that Allen was living in Paignton, captaining Chudleigh cricket team and working as an ambulance driver for the South & West Devon Health Authority",
    "summary": "Kenny Allen's return to Torquay United in April 1989 was a significant moment in the club's history. The former England international had left the club in 1986 after a successful spell, during which he had helped the club win the English League Two title. In 1989, Allen was lured back to Torquay by former manager John Sheridan, who had taken charge of the club in 1986. The decision proved to be a masterstroke, as the club reached the final of the Associate Members' Cup, their first major trophy since the 1950s. Allen played a crucial role in the team's success, scoring the winning goal in the final against Exeter City. His return was a significant moment in the club's history, and it set the stage for a period of sustained success, culminating in the club's promotion to the Football League in 1992."

The film was screened at the International Film Festival Rotterdam and opened to positive reviews from critics. The film had its theatrical release in Sri Lanka on 3 November 2023. This is also regarded as potentially the first Sri Lankan fully fledged home-grown local Tamil film in the history of Sri Lankan cinema, as most of the crew members who were on board had been native Sri Lankans.\nThe film revolves around a former rebel who was accused of having close links with the LTTE members and he eventually returns home after being released on bail from the military detention. He goes in search of his missing girlfriend and the fate of the rebel was yet to be revealed by his soothsaying mother.",
    "summary": "\"Munnel\" is a 2018 Indian Tamil-language film. The film was written, directed, and produced by S. Shankar. It stars Vijay in the lead role, alongside Trisha Krishnan and Nayanthara. The film is a romantic drama and was well-received for its storytelling and performances."

    "summary": "The dune lark (Ammomanes deserti) is unique among birds in relation to the Namib Desert for several reasons. Firstly, it is one of the few bird species that has adapted to the extreme arid conditions of the desert. The dune lark has a specialized plumage that reflects sunlight, helping to keep it cool during the day. It also has a long, slender beak that is well-suited for probing the sand in search of insects, which are a primary food source in the desert.\n\n\nAnother unique aspect of the dune lark is its breeding behavior. Unlike many desert birds that nest in burrows, the dune lark builds its nest on the surface of the sand dunes. This unusual nesting strategy is thought to be an adaptation to the shifting sands of the desert, as it allows the lark to quickly relocate its nest if necessary.\n\n\nAdditionally, the dune lark has a distinctive call that is used to communicate with other members of its species. This call is particularly important in the vast, open desert environment where visual cues are limited.\n\n\nOverall, the dune lark's adaptations to the Namib Desert, including its plumage, beak, nesting behavior, and communication methods, make it a unique and fascinating bird species in this harsh and challenging environment."

    "summary": "The diet of the redbanded perch (Oregonichthys crameri) is influenced by several factors, including:\n\n\n1. **Water Temperature**: Redbanded perch are cold-water fish, and their feeding activity is higher in cooler water temperatures. As the water warms, their metabolism slows down, and they feed less.\n\n\n2. **Seasonal Changes**: During the spring and summer, redbanded perch are more active and have a higher feeding rate, while in the fall and winter, they become less active and feed less frequently.\n\n\n3. **Availability of Prey**: The diet of redbanded perch consists mainly of small invertebrates, such as insects, crustaceans, and worms. The availability of these prey items in their habitat directly affects their diet.\n\n\n4. **Age and Size**: Juvenile redbanded perch tend to have a more varied diet, including a higher proportion of smaller prey, while adults may focus on larger prey items.\n\n\n5. **Habitat Type**: The type of habitat, such as streams, rivers, or lakes, can influence the types of prey available to redbanded perch and, consequently, their diet. For example, they may feed more on benthic invertebrates in streams and on zooplankton in lakes.\n\n\n6. **Competition**: The presence of other fish species that compete for the same food resources can affect the diet of redbanded perch, potentially leading them to seek alternative food sources."

A small group of people, known as syndicates, started controlling any large monetary transactions including selling of land, construction of buildings, buying of material goods. These people, often connected to the ruling political party, demand a share of any large transaction happening in an area.\nThese practices mostly happen in the construction business, but have recently spread to most sphere of life including building individual residential houses. Corrupt groups often also force builders and consumers to buy from a particular vendor, connected to the same groups and political party officials. Sometimes, this leads to supply of inferior quality materials at a premium price. The Kolkata flyover collapse has been also linked to low quality raw materials supplied by such syndicates. The Narada sting operation exposes close links of syndicates to the top party officials of AITC, showing party leaders taking large sums of money from an unknown businessman.",
    "summary": "The Syndicate Raj, a term used to describe a system of political corruption and influence peddling, became particularly prevalent in the Indian state of West Bengal during the late 2000s. This period saw significant political turmoil and allegations of corruption involving the ruling Trinamool Congress party, led by Mamata Banerjee, and its interactions with various political and business entities. The term \"Syndicate Raj\" was used to describe the alleged network of politicians, bureaucrats, and businesspeople who were believed to be manipulating political outcomes and resources for their own benefit."

The Great Britain national ice hockey team, which was formed in 1920, primarily consisted of players from the United Kingdom, Ireland, and sometimes other Commonwealth countries.\n\nLeacock's exclusion from the Great Britain team in 1935 would not be due to any disallowed action but rather because he was not a player for that team. Leacock's career was primarily with the Montreal Canadiens, one of the most successful teams in the National Hockey League (NHL). His achievements and contributions were significant in Canadian ice hockey, but they did not intersect with the Great Britain national team.\n\nIf you are looking for specific details about a particular incident involving Leacock and the Great Britain team, it would be helpful to have more context or details about the event in question. However, based on historical records, Leacock was not a member of the Great Britain national team, and any mention of his exclusion would be a misunderstanding."

He was born around 100 BC and held various political and military positions throughout his career. However, there is limited historical information available about his death, and it is not well-documented in the surviving ancient sources.\n\nOne of the most notable events associated with Quintianus is his involvement in the Catilinarian conspiracy of 63 BC, led by Lucius Sergius Catilina. Quintianus, along with other senators, played a crucial role in exposing the conspiracy, which ultimately led to the downfall of Catilina and his co-conspirators. After the conspiracy was uncovered, Quintianus was appointed as a consul in 60 BC, serving alongside Gaius Julius Caesar.\n\nDespite his significant contributions to Roman politics and military affairs, Quintianus's later years and death are not well-documented. It is possible that he continued to serve in various capacities, but the lack of detailed records makes it difficult to provide a comprehensive account of his final years and the circumstances surrounding his death.\n\nIn summary, Tiberius Claudius Pompeianus Quintianus was a prominent Roman senator and military commander who played a key role in exposing the Catilinarian conspiracy.

    "summary": "Ekamra Kshetra, also known as the \"One Temple\" or \"Ek Mandir,\" is a significant Hindu temple located in the town of Ekamra, near the city of Bhubaneswar in the state of Odisha, India. The temple is dedicated to Lord Jagannath, a form of Lord Vishnu, and is part of the famous Jagannath Temple complex in Puri.\n\nThe architectural and historical heritage of Ekamra Kshetra, like many ancient Indian temples, spans several centuries. The temple itself is believed to have been constructed in the 12th century during the reign of the Ganga dynasty. However, the temple complex has undergone various renovations and expansions over the centuries, reflecting the rich history and cultural evolution of the region.\n\nGiven the continuous historical significance and the ongoing cultural practices associated with the temple, its heritage can be considered to span over a millennium, from its origins in the 12th century to the present day. This makes the architectural and historical heritage of Ekamra Kshetra span approximately 900 years."

The description includes the species' name, the author of the description, and the year of publication. This information is often found in the original publication or in taxonomic databases.\n\nTo find the specific details about the first description of the female of the Tjurunga paroculus species, you would need to look at the original scientific literature where the species was first described.

    "summary": "Quadrant roadway intersections, also known as T-intersections or Y-intersections, are a type of road design where two roads intersect at a right angle, forming a \"T\" shape. While they can be efficient in certain contexts, they have faced several criticisms from opponents. Here are some of the main points of contention:\n\n1. **Increased Risk of Accidents**: Opponents argue that quadrant intersections can increase the risk of accidents, particularly for pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers unfamiliar with the layout. The sharp angles and multiple entry and exit points can create confusion and lead to collisions.\n\n2. **Pedestrian Safety Concerns**: Pedestrians may find it more difficult to cross at quadrant intersections, especially if there are no dedicated crosswalks or pedestrian signals. This can lead to increased pedestrian accidents and a sense of insecurity among pedestrians.\n\n3. **Traffic Congestion**: Critics claim that quadrant intersections can lead to traffic congestion, as vehicles may have to slow down or stop to navigate the intersection, especially during peak hours. This can result in longer travel times and increased frustration for drivers.\n\n4. **Complexity in Navigation**: The layout of quadrant intersections can be confusing for drivers, particularly those who are not familiar with the area. This can lead to hesitation, mistakes, and potential accidents.\n\n5. **Limited Space for Larger Vehicles**: Quadrant intersections may not be suitable for larger vehicles such as trucks and buses, which require more space to maneuver. This can limit the types of vehicles that can use the intersection efficiently.\n\n6. **Environmental Impact**: Opponents argue that the increased traffic congestion and potential for accidents can lead to higher emissions and a greater environmental impact. This is particularly concerning in urban areas where air quality is already a significant issue.\n\n7. **Maintenance and Upkeep**: Quadrant intersections may require more maintenance and upkeep compared to other types of intersections. This can include the need for more frequent repairs, resurfacing, and the installation of additional traffic control devices.\n\n8. **Cost of Implementation**: The construction and implementation of quadrant intersections can be more expensive than other types of intersections. This includes the cost of land acquisition, construction, and the installation of necessary traffic control devices.\n\n9. **Impact on Local Businesses**: Some critics argue that quadrant intersections can negatively impact local businesses by reducing the visibility and accessibility of the area.

In this case, the House of Lords (now the Supreme Court) held that for a person to successfully claim duress as a defense, they must have an honest and reasonable belief that there was an immediate threat of death or serious injury to themselves or another person, and that there was no reasonable opportunity to escape the threat. The stipulation made by this case is that the belief in the threat must be both honest and reasonable, and the person claiming duress must have had no reasonable opportunity to avoid the threat. This case has been influential in shaping the understanding of the duress defense in English law, particularly in cases involving threats of violence."

Schmadel compiled these citations into the Dictionary of Minor Planet Names (DMP) and regularly updated the collection.\nBased on Paul Herget's The Names of the Minor Planets, Schmadel also researched the unclear origin of numerous asteroids, most of which had been named prior to World War II.  This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain: SBDB New namings may only be added to this list below after official publication as the preannouncement of names is condemned. The WGSBN publishes a comprehensive guideline for the naming rules of non-cometary small Solar System bodies.",
    "summary": "The organization responsible for assigning permanent numbers to confirmed minor planet discoveries is the Minor Planet Center (MPC). The MPC is a division of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) and serves as the official clearinghouse for asteroid and comet observations. When a new minor planet is discovered, the MPC assigns it a provisional designation, and once the orbit of the object is well determined, it is given a permanent number and name."

    "summary": "The Blue Ridge of North Carolina is known for its rich geological history, which includes a variety of ancient rock formations. The most prominent types of ancient rocks found in this region are:\n\n1. **Gneiss**: This is a high-grade metamorphic rock that has been subjected to intense heat and pressure, resulting in a foliated texture. Gneiss is often found in the Blue Ridge Mountains and is a key component of the region's geological makeup.\n\n2. **Schist**: Another type of metamorphic rock, schist is characterized by its pronounced foliation and the presence of visible mineral grains. It forms under similar conditions to gneiss but with a slightly different mineral composition and texture.\n\n3. **Granite**: This igneous rock is composed mainly of quartz, feldspar, and mica. Granite is a common rock in the Blue Ridge Mountains and is often exposed in the form of outcrops and domes.\n\n4. **Slate**: Slate is a fine-grained metamorphic rock that forms from shale. It is known for its ability to split into thin, durable sheets and is often used in roofing and flooring.\n\n5. **Quartzite**: This is a non-foliated metamorphic rock that forms from the metamorphism of quartz-rich sandstone. Quartzite is very hard and resistant to weathering, making it a prominent feature in the Blue Ridge region.\n\nThese ancient rocks are part of the Appalachian Mountains, which were formed over 480 million years ago during the assembly of the supercontinent Pangaea. The Blue Ridge Mountains are a part of the Appalachian orogeny, a series of mountain-building events that shaped the eastern United States."

    "summary": "Giovanni Conti, also known as Giovanni Battista Conti, was an Italian painter and sculptor of the Baroque period, active in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. He was born in 1660 in Florence, Italy, and was a student of the renowned sculptor and architect Gian Lorenzo Bernini. Bernini was a pivotal figure in the development of Baroque art, and his influence on Conti was significant.\n\nFrom his training under Bernini, it can be inferred that Giovanni Conti would have been exposed to the dramatic, dynamic, and highly emotional style characteristic of Bernini's work. Bernini's sculptures often featured intricate details, a sense of movement, and a strong emotional impact, all of which would have been essential elements in Conti's artistic development.\n\nConti's early artistic influences would have also included the works of other prominent Baroque artists such as Caravaggio, whose use of chiaroscuro (the contrast between light and dark) and dramatic compositions would have been part of the Baroque aesthetic that Conti would have been exposed to. Additionally, the influence of the Venetian school, known for its rich color palette and emphasis on light, would have been part of the broader artistic context in which Conti was trained.\n\nAs a sculptor, Conti would have been influenced by the classical traditions of sculpture, as well as the evolving tastes of the Baroque period, which favored more naturalistic and expressive forms. His work would have reflected a blend of these influences, combining the classical ideals of beauty and proportion with the emotional intensity and theatricality of the Baroque style.\n\nIn summary, Giovanni Conti's training under Gian Lorenzo Bernini and his exposure to the works of other Baroque masters would have shaped his artistic style, leading to a body of work that combined the dramatic expressiveness of the Baroque with the classical traditions of sculpture."

It is often something to be avoided by car manufacturers as higher levels of body flex is a sign of structural weakness, and means that the vehicle's suspension cannot work as efficiently - the body takes up some of the 'slack', rather than the parts of the car which were specifically designed for this purpose. Body flex is usually caused by using weaker materials to build the chassis, so the car body will twist easier when cornering. Body flex will affect the stability and handling of the car, it will also contribute to body rolling. Severe body flex will weaken the chassis even more by adding stress onto it, which might eventually cause chassis failure. Therefore, sports car's chassis are often very 'stiff' to improve performance. Convertibles and older cars often have more body flex because of their lack of a rigid roof to support the car body and the lack of modern structural reinforcements. Since body flex is twisting the car body, it will also lead to rattles and squeaks.\nSometimes body flex is the result of reducing weight, manufactures will choose lighter materials to build the chassis, but the cost might be a weaker chassis. Makers such as Audi (the A8), and Jaguar (with the 2003 XJ8) use aluminium in chassis production to get around this obstacle, ensuring the weight of these cars and their level of body flex can both be kept to a minimum.\nTypically, the stiffness of the body is measured in torsion. The body is supported at the spring caps at the rear, and then a torque is applied to the front spring caps via a long beam and a fulcrum.

    "summary": "Body flex refers to the slight bending or flexing of a car's body, particularly the chassis, when the vehicle is subjected to forces such as acceleration, braking, cornering, or when encountering uneven road surfaces. This flex can be due to the materials used in the construction of the car's body, the design of the suspension system, and the overall structural integrity of the vehicle.\n\nCar manufacturers generally avoid excessive body flex for several reasons:\n\n1. **Ride Comfort**: Excessive body flex can lead to a less comfortable ride for passengers. It can cause the car to feel \"bouncy\" or \"wobbly,\" which can be unpleasant, especially on rough or uneven roads.\n\n2. **Handling and Stability**: Body flex can negatively impact the car's handling and stability. When the body flexes excessively, it can lead to unpredictable behavior, making the car harder to control, especially during high-speed maneuvers or in emergency situations.\n\n3. **Safety**: Excessive body flex can compromise the structural integrity of the vehicle, potentially leading to safety issues. In the event of a collision, a car with significant body flex may not perform as well in protecting its occupants, as the flexing could lead to more deformation of the passenger cabin.\n\n4. **Durability**: Over time, excessive body flex can lead to wear and tear on various components of the vehicle, including the suspension, steering, and other critical systems. This can result in increased maintenance costs and a shorter lifespan for the vehicle.\n\nTo mitigate these issues, car manufacturers invest in high-quality materials, advanced engineering, and rigorous testing to ensure that their vehicles have minimal body flex. This includes using stronger materials, designing more rigid chassis structures, and optimizing the suspension system to provide a balance between comfort, handling, and safety."

    "body": "The Assault on Mount Mitchell is an annual bicycling endurance contest in South Carolina and North Carolina first held in 1974.\nFor several years starting in 1992, completing The Assault on Marion was a prerequisite implemented to increase the proportion of finishers, but this requirement was dropped in recent years.\nThe ride starts in Spartanburg, South Carolina and ends at the summit of Mount Mitchell in Mount Mitchell State Park in Yancey County, North Carolina.  The ride distance is 102 miles (164 km) and has over 11,000 vertical feet of climbing.  Most riders finish in less than 12 hours; the leaders finish in under 6 hours. The contest typically includes over 800 cyclists from across the globe. \nIt spawned the Off-Road Assault on Mount Mitchell, which has taken place since 1999.\nThe record number of consecutive finishes is 40 (as of 2020), held by Michael H. Davis.\nAs of 2015, the contest has a charitable component, The Freewheelers Cycling Association. This 501(c)(3) organization is partnered with nonprofit organizations such as the Humane Society and Mt. Mitchell State Park. \nAs a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the contest was cancelled for the years 2020 and 2021.",
    "summary": "As of my last update in April 2023, I don't have specific information on changes made to \"The Assault on Mount Mitchell\" regarding prerequisites from 1992 onwards. \"The Assault on Mount Mitchell\" could refer to a specific event, a book, a movie, or another type of content, and without more context, it's challenging to provide accurate information.\n\nIf \"The Assault on Mount Mitchell\" refers to a climbing expedition or a significant event related to Mount Mitchell, which is the highest peak in the Appalachian Mountains located in North Carolina, USA, any changes to prerequisites would likely involve safety regulations, environmental concerns, or access permissions. Over the years, such changes could include:\n\n1. **Safety Regulations**: Updates to safety protocols, including the requirement for climbers to have certain certifications, to carry specific safety gear, or to be accompanied by a guide.\n\n2. **Environmental Concerns**: Changes in regulations to protect the environment, such as restrictions on the number of climbers allowed per season, or the implementation of new trails to reduce erosion and impact on the ecosystem.\n\n3. **Access Permissions**: Changes in land use or ownership that could affect who has the right to access the mountain, possibly requiring climbers to obtain permits or pay fees.\n\n4. **Infrastructure**: Improvements or changes to the infrastructure, such as the construction of new trails, restrooms, or parking areas, which could affect the prerequisites for access.\n\n5. **Seasonal Changes**: Adjustments to the climbing season based on weather patterns, snow cover, or other environmental factors.\n\nTo get the most current and accurate information, I recommend checking the official website of the National Park Service, which manages Mount Mitchell, or contacting local climbing clubs, guides, or the park's visitor center. They would have the latest information on any changes to prerequisites for climbing or visiting Mount Mitchell."

Lawyers informally define a demurrer as a defendant saying \"So what?\" to the pleading.\nTypically, the defendant in a case will demur to the complaint, but it is also possible for the plaintiff to demur to an answer. The demurrer challenges the legal sufficiency of a cause of action in a complaint or of an affirmative defense in an answer. If a cause of action in a complaint does not state a cognizable claim or if it does not state all the required elements, then the challenged cause of action or possibly the entire complaint can be dismissed at the demurrer stage as not legally sufficient. A demurrer is typically filed near the beginning of a case in response to the plaintiff filing a complaint or the defendant answering the complaint.\nIn common law, a demurrer was the pleading through which a defendant challenged the legal sufficiency of a complaint in criminal or civil cases. Today, however, the pleading has been discontinued in many jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, the U.S. federal court system, and most U.S. states (though some states, including California, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, retain it).  In criminal cases, a demurrer was considered a common law due process right, to be heard and decided before the defendant was required to plead \"not guilty,\" or make any other pleading in response, without having to admit or deny any of the facts alleged.\nA demurrer generally assumes the truth of all material facts alleged in the complaint, and the defendant cannot present evidence to the contrary, even if those facts appear to be obvious fabrications by the plaintiff or are likely to be easily disproved during litigation.

Anson lost her first Olympic bout to a younger and more seasoned Mongolian opponent, Munkhzaya Tsedevsuren. Tsedevsuren went on to compete in the quarter finals before losing to the eventual gold medalist, Slovenia's Urka olnir. Anson's bout lasted 46 seconds, before her 26-year-old Mongolian opponent emerged with the victory. Anson's defeat resulted from an Ippon, or technical knockout, and a perfect score of 110 to 0 for Tsedevsuren, the highest possible score in judo. The strangling technique used by Tsedevsuren in her victory over Anson is known as a okuri eri jime.\nThe 46 second round was the shortest contest in the elimination round of 32. After the match, Anson stated that, \"when I was out there, everything blacked out in my head\". Later she added, when the fight started, I forgot everything. I wanted to be defensive-minded but still trying to be aggressive. All of sudden I was on the mat and the fight was lost.\nAt 35 years, Anson was also the oldest competitor among the 24 contestants in the 63k category, followed by 33-year-old Elisabeth Willeboordse of the Netherlands. The majority of the Olympic athletes were in their 20s. Anson continues to coach and mentor youngsters in Palau, and she explained that she intended to continue to try and set an example for younger members of her judo club in Palau.\nMs. Anson serves as the National Security Coordinator for the Republic of Palau.",

Lawyer and congressional candidate Nels Ackerson was born in Eagletown, and in 2006 with his sister Karen Ackerson Jamesen announced plans for \"...a 1900s-themed, master-planned community with a mix of 1,125 houses, townhouses, condos and apartments and up to 1.5 million square feet of retailing, restaurants, office and business buildings...\" on their former family farm.\nMusician Josh \"The Reverend\" Peyton of the country blues band The Reverend Peyton's Big Damn Band was born in Eagletown.",
    "summary": "The original name for Eagletown in Westfield Washington Township, Hamilton County, Indiana, came from the presence of Bald Eagles in the area. The community was initially named \"Eagle's Town,\" as it was a common site for eagles nesting along the White River during the early 1800s when settlers arrived in the region. This name later evolved into its current form, \"Eagletown.\" It serves as a testament to the rich natural history and wildlife that once thrived throughout the region."

    "summary": "\nAs an AI entity, I can provide you with information about the General Educational Development (GED) Test, also known as the GED Credential or GED diploma. The GED Testing Service is responsible for the development and administration of these proficiency tests.\n\nThe GED Test has evolved significantly since its inception in 1942. A major change occurred in 1988 when the GED Test was redesigned and standardized across states. This aimed to improve the credibility and relevance of the test, ensuring that it aligned with high school expectations.\n\nIn 2014, the GED Test underwent another significant transformation, known as GED Transformation 2014. This revamp focused on four key areas:\n\n1. Content: The test now covers content from traditional high schools (math, science, social studies, language arts) instead of technical or vocational skills.\n2. Structure: The test switched from five separate subject tests to a single, integrated exam divided into four sections that could be taken at different times: Reasoning Through Language Arts (RLA), Mathematical Reasoning, Science, and Social Studies.\n3. Format: Tests became computer-based, replacing paper-and-pencil formats, allowing instant scoring and improved access for test takers.\n4. Scoring: A new 100-200 point scale was introduced, with scores above 145 in each subject indicating college readiness.\n\nSince then, there have been minor adjustments made based on feedback and analysis, but the core structure remains largely unchanged. As technology advances, it's likely that future changes will include further improvements in online/remote testing options, adaptive assessments, and enhanced data analytics for personalized learning experiences."

He was the fastest South African to take 100 wickets in Tests (in terms of matches played) until Dale Steyn claimed the record in March 2008. He was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1956. He was known as 'Toey' due to his habit of stubbing his toes into the ground before every delivery. He would also kiss the badge on his cap before handing it to the umpire at the start of every over.\nThe Tayfields were a cricketing family; Hugh's uncle Sidney Martin played for Worcestershire County Cricket Club and his brothers Arthur and Cyril both played for the Transvaal cricket team as did two cousins, Hugh Martin and Ian Tayfield.\nTayfield made his debut for Natal as a 17-year-old in 194546. He took a hat-trick against Transvaal aged 18 and, when Athol Rowan was injured, he was hurried into the South African Test side against Australia in 194950. He played in all five Tests and, on a sticky wicket at Durban, took seven wicket for 23 when Australia crashed from 31 for no wicket to 75 all out.\nAfter a quiet tour to England in 1951 when he was called up as a substitute for Rowan, he became South Africa's mainstay in Australia in 195253 under Jack Cheetham. He claimed 30 wickets in the series, 13 of them at Melbourne, to secure South Africa's first win over Australia in 42 years. Tayfield returned to England with more success in 1955, taking 143 wickets on the tour and 26 in the series including nine in South Africa's victory at Headingley. In the defeat at the Oval, the match which decided the rubber, he took five wickets for 60 runs in 53.3 overs.\nBowling for South Africa against England at Durban in 195657, he bowled 119 balls in England's first innings followed immediately by a further 18 in the second without conceding a run, a Test and first-class cricket record. He bowled over the wicket, close to the stumps, drifting the ball away from the bat in the air and then spinning it back through the gate. He did not spin the ball as much as England's Jim Laker but was unerringly accurate and could bowl for long spells. He set himself aggressive fields, in contrast to his steady bowling, with two silly mid ons for the snick prompted by a botched drive through the tempting hole he'd left at cover. He formed a fine partnership with Trevor Goddard and, backed by South Africa's athletic fielding, took 37 wickets at a bowling average of 17.18 runs per wicket against England in the 195657 series. He took nine for 113 in the second innings of the Fourth Test at Johannesburg, bowling unchanged on the last day, and was carried off the field by his teammates. Tayfield caught the only batsman he didn't dismiss.\nIn England in 1960 he took 123 wickets on the tour but failed in the Tests and, his career on the wane, lost his place in 196162.

    "summary": "\nIn 2011, Fine Gael formed a coalition government with Labour Party in Ireland after winning the general election. This marked a significant shift as it ended Fianna Fil's dominance that had lasted for over six decades. Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny became the Taoiseach (Prime Minister) of Ireland. This government aimed at addressing the economic crisis and implementing several much-needed reforms. The Fine Gael-Labour coalition represented a progressive and centrist political alliance, which focused on fiscal responsibility, economic growth, social inclusion, and public service modernization. However, the coalition later fell due to decreased support and unfavorable election results, but its legacy in ending the longstanding Fianna Fil rule and introducing new perspectives still holds significance."

    "summary": "The Blackness Public Art Programme was developed by Dundee City Council in Scotland as part of a larger initiative to encourage public art across the city. The programme specifically focused on engaging with black artists and promoting their work in areas with significant black populations or neighborhoods. This program aimed to provide platforms for creative expression, promote cultural understanding, and enhance community cohesion by representing diverse perspectives through public art. \n\nThe influence of the Blackness Public Art Programme on the broader Dundee Public Art Programme can be seen in several ways:\n\n1. Increased representation: The success of the Blackness Public Art Programme likely influenced the broader Dundee Public Art Programme to become more inclusive of different ethnicities and backgrounds in commissioning and selecting artists for public art projects.\n2. Greater awareness of diverse cultures: By showcasing the work of black artists through the Blackness Public Art Programme, the broader public became more aware of the contributions and experiences of these artists and communities. This heightened awareness likely influenced subsequent art commissions and installations under the larger Dundee Public Art Programme.\n3. Community engagement: The Blackness Public Art Programme's focus on engaging with local communities and artists may have inspired other initiatives within the broader Dundee Public Art Programme to do the same, fostering stronger connections between artists and their audiences.\n4. Addressing historical disparities: Recognizing the underrepresentation of black artists in traditional art spaces, the Blackness Public Art Programme aimed to address these disparities. This consciousness likely carried over into the broader Dundee Public Art Programme, encouraging a wider commitment to creating opportunities for marginalized groups and ensuring more equitable representation in public art.\n\nOverall, the Blackness Public Art Programme was an important step toward increased equity and inclusion within public art in Dundee, and its influence is evident in the broader efforts of the Dundee Public Art Programme to engage with diverse communities and support the work of artists from various backgrounds."

However, due to societal prejudices at the time and limited government support, fundraising efforts were difficult, and it became increasingly challenging for HCHS to sustain its operations. This led to the eventual closure of the organization in 1984. Despite this setback, HCHS is considered an important pioneer in the fight for healthcare equality for the LGBTQ+ community."

    "summary": "\nExtensive growth is an economic concept that refers to increasing the scale of operations by adding more inputs or resources such as labor, capital, or land. Diminishing returns, also known as the law of diminishing marginal returns, is an economic principle stating that in all productive processes, adding more of one factor of production, while holding all others constant (ceteris paribus), will at some point yield lower incremental per-unit returns.\n\nThere are a few reasons why extensive growth may experience diminishing returns:\n\n1. Limited Resources: When you keep adding more inputs without changing any other factors, there might come a time when essential resources become scarce. For instance, if you're producing goods with only labor and machines, eventually, you might not have enough machines for each additional worker, leading to less productivity.\n\n2. Inefficiency: As you add more resources, you might reach a point where managing them becomes challenging. This can lead to inefficiencies, such as longer communication lines, duplication of work, lack of coordination, and so on, which ultimately decreases productivity.\n\n3. Overcrowding or Congestion: In manufacturing processes, having too many workers or machines in a small space can result in overcrowding or congestion. This can slow down the process, affect quality, and reduce productivity.\n\n4. Increasing Marginal Costs: When you keep adding more inputs, there comes a point where the costs of adding an additional input start rising. For example, hiring another worker may require additional equipment, training, or infrastructure, all of which increase costs.\n\n5. Law of Variable Proportions: This principle states that when we increase one input while keeping other inputs constant, there will eventually be a point where output growth slows down due to resource underutilization or increased inefficiencies.\n\nIn summary, extensive growth is likely to be subject to diminishing returns because of issues related to limited resources, inefficiency, overcrowding or congestion, increasing marginal costs, and the law of variable proportions. Understanding these concepts helps businesses optimize their operations and make better strategic decisions."

    "summary": "The exact etymology of Mycobacterium moriokaense is not provided in the given text. However, I can explain how the etymology of a bacterium often reflects its geographical discovery. Bacteria are often named after the location of their discovery, in order to provide a clear identification of the species. This naming convention is similar to the naming of places or geographic locations. Therefore, if we know that Mycobacterium moriokaense was discovered in a specific location called Morioka, it is likely that its name was chosen to reflect this geographic connection."

It has a place for prayer (the main sanctuary and sometimes smaller chapels) where Jews attend religious services or special ceremonies such as weddings, bar and bat mitzvahs, choir performances, and children's plays. They also have rooms for study, social halls, administrative and charitable offices, classrooms for religious and Hebrew studies, and many places to sit and congregate. They often display commemorative, historic, or modern artwork alongside items of Jewish historical significance or history about the synagogue itself.\nSynagogues are consecrated spaces used for Jewish prayer, study, assembly, and reading of the Torah (read in its entirety once a year, or in some synagogues on a triennial cycle, in weekly Torah portions during religious services). However, a synagogue is not always necessary for Jewish worship, due to adaptations during times of Jewish persecution in countries and regions that banned Judaism, frequently destroying and/or reappropriating synagogues into churches or even government buildings. Halakha (Jewish law from the Mishnah  the \"Oral Torah\") states that communal Jewish worship can be carried out wherever a minyan, a group of at least 10 Jewish adults, is assembled, often (but not necessarily) led by a rabbi. Worship can also happen alone or with fewer than ten people, but certain prayers are considered by halakha as solely communal; these can be recited only by a minyan. In terms of its specific ritual and liturgical functions, the synagogue does not replace the symbol of the long-destroyed Temple in Jerusalem.\nAny Jew or group of Jews can build a synagogue. Synagogues have been constructed by ancient Jewish leaders, wealthy patrons, and as part of a wide range of human institutions, including secular educational institutions, governments, and hotels. They have been built by the entire Jewish community living in a particular village or region, or by sub-groups of Jewish people organized by occupation, tradition/background (e.g., the Sephardic, Yemenite, Romaniote or Persian Jews of a town), style of religious observance (e.g., Orthodox or Reform synagogues), or by the followers of a particular rabbi, such as the shtiebelekh (Yiddish: , romanized: shtibelekh, singular  shtibl) of Hasidic Judaism.",

They often display commemorative, historic, or modern artwork alongside items of Jewish historical significance or history about the synagogue itself.\nSynagogues are consecrated spaces used for Jewish prayer, study, assembly, and reading of the Torah (read in its entirety once a year, or in some synagogues on a triennial cycle, in weekly Torah portions during religious services). However, a synagogue is not always necessary for Jewish worship, due to adaptations during times of Jewish persecution in countries and regions that banned Judaism, frequently destroying and/or reappropriating synagogues into churches or even government buildings. Halakha (Jewish law from the Mishnah  the \"Oral Torah\") states that communal Jewish worship can be carried out wherever a minyan, a group of at least 10 Jewish adults, is assembled, often (but not necessarily) led by a rabbi. Worship can also happen alone or with fewer than ten people, but certain prayers are considered by halakha as solely communal; these can be recited only by a minyan. In terms of its specific ritual and liturgical functions, the synagogue does not replace the symbol of the long-destroyed Temple in Jerusalem.\nAny Jew or group of Jews can build a synagogue. Synagogues have been constructed by ancient Jewish leaders, wealthy patrons, and as part of a wide range of human institutions, including secular educational institutions, governments, and hotels. They have been built by the entire Jewish community living in a particular village or region, or by sub-groups of Jewish people organized by occupation, tradition/background (e.g., the Sephardic, Yemenite, Romaniote or Persian Jews of a town), style of religious observance (e.g., Orthodox or Reform synagogues), or by the followers of a particular rabbi, such as the shtiebelekh (Yiddish: , romanized: shtibelekh, singular  shtibl) of Hasidic Judaism.",
    "summary": "Historically, synagogues have been adapted during times of Jewish persecution in various ways. One of the most common adaptations was the use of hidden synagogues or \"shtetls\" during the time of the Nazi regime. These hidden synagogues were secret prayer rooms designed to provide a sense of community and continue Jewish traditions in difficult times. Additionally, some synagogues have incorporated modern designs and architectural features that reflect the changing needs and values of Jewish communities. Others have transformed into museums or cultural centers, serving as symbols of resilience and preservation of Jewish heritage. These adaptations have allowed synagogues to remain relevant and meaningful to Jewish communities throughout history, even in the face of significant adversity."

Throughout the pandemic, various states, counties, and municipalities have issued health orders requiring the wearing of non-medical face coverings  such as cloth masks  in spaces and businesses accessible to the public, especially when physical distancing is not possible.\nFederal officials initially discouraged the general public from wearing masks for protecting themselves from COVID-19. In early April, federal officials reversed their guidance, saying that the general public should wear masks to lessen transmission by themselves, particularly from asymptomatic carriers. Public health experts such as Larry Gostin stated that federal officials should have recommended mask-wearing sooner; others noted that US government guidance lagged significantly behind mask recommendations in East Asian countries and likely exacerbated the scale of the pandemic in the United States.\nPresident Donald Trump largely resisted wearing masks in public media appearances, and did not mandate their use at his campaign events during the 2020 presidential election. After briefly encouraging their use in mid-July, Trump continued to hold campaign events (such as the 2020 Republican National Convention) where masks were not widely used, and publicly mocked Joe Biden for wearing face masks in public appearances. After Biden was sworn in as president in January 2021, his first executive orders included mandating the wearing of masks on public transport systems and more vigorous enforcement of COVID-19-related health and safety protocols, including masks on federal properties.\nIn April and May 2021, as the country's vaccination program increased in pace, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued successive guidelines stating that fully vaccinated individuals did not need to wear masks or physically distance when in public. The announcement faced a mixed reception, with critics arguing that this guidance primarily relied on an honor system, and may have been premature given the country's progress on vaccination at the time. In July, due to rising cases mainly caused by the more transmissible Delta variant, the CDC issued a recommendation that face masks be worn by anyone in an indoor public space if \"substantial and high transmission\" exists locally. The CDC mask mandate for public transport was further extended into 2022, due to the similar threat of the Omicron variant. By late-February 2022, the CDC had adjusted its metrics for \"substantial and high transmission\" to account for mitigating factors, stating that masks were not necessarily needed in roughly 70 of the country. By April 2022, nearly all state-level mask mandates had been lifted, and the CDC's mask mandate for airplanes and public transport was struck down as unlawful.\nMask mandates have been divisive with attitudes generally varying along the political spectrum. Republican-led states were, initially, less likely to impose health orders requiring the wearing of masks than Democratic-led states. Several states, including Arizona, Georgia, and Texas, took actions to block localized health orders requiring masks, but later softened their stances to help control local spikes.\nThe evidence in 2022 suggested that masks may have been effective at reducing the transmission of the virus, however, mask mandates for the general population did not work. Covid spread at similar rates in cities without mask mandates as it did in cities that instituted mandates.",

After Biden was sworn in as president in January 2021, his first executive orders included mandating the wearing of masks on public transport systems and more vigorous enforcement of COVID-19-related health and safety protocols, including masks on federal properties.\nIn April and May 2021, as the country's vaccination program increased in pace, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued successive guidelines stating that fully vaccinated individuals did not need to wear masks or physically distance when in public. The announcement faced a mixed reception, with critics arguing that this guidance primarily relied on an honor system, and may have been premature given the country's progress on vaccination at the time. In July, due to rising cases mainly caused by the more transmissible Delta variant, the CDC issued a recommendation that face masks be worn by anyone in an indoor public space if \"substantial and high transmission\" exists locally. The CDC mask mandate for public transport was further extended into 2022, due to the similar threat of the Omicron variant. By late-February 2022, the CDC had adjusted its metrics for \"substantial and high transmission\" to account for mitigating factors, stating that masks were not necessarily needed in roughly 70 of the country. By April 2022, nearly all state-level mask mandates had been lifted, and the CDC's mask mandate for airplanes and public transport was struck down as unlawful.\nMask mandates have been divisive with attitudes generally varying along the political spectrum. Republican-led states were, initially, less likely to impose health orders requiring the wearing of masks than Democratic-led states. Several states, including Arizona, Georgia, and Texas, took actions to block localized health orders requiring masks, but later softened their stances to help control local spikes.\nThe evidence in 2022 suggested that masks may have been effective at reducing the transmission of the virus, however, mask mandates for the general population did not work. Covid spread at similar rates in cities without mask mandates as it did in cities that instituted mandates.",
    "summary": "On April 3, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended the following measures to help lessen the transmission of COVID-19:\n\n1. Wear a mask or cloth face covering if you're sick or if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or a sneeze.\n2. Practice social distancing of at least 6 feet (2 meters).\n3. Stay 6 feet from other people when you need to go out, such as shopping for groceries or getting other essential supplies.\n4. Practice good respiratory hygiene. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 alcohol.\n5. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces often, such as doorways, light switches, and countertops. Use regular household cleaning sprays or wipes.\n\nThese recommendations were designed to slow the spread of the virus and save lives."

    "summary": "Members of the order Vestigastropoda have a reduced body form, often with a reduced shell and a small tentacle-like reproductive appendage. Their reproductive characteristics are generally characterized by a low level of sexual dimorphism, with males and females having a similar appearance. This is because they are adapted to live in the deep sea, where sexual organs may be less necessary due to the possibility of reproducing asexually.\n\nThe reproductive strategy of Vestigastropoda may vary. Some species use internal fertilization, with eggs being fertilized within the female's body, while others employ external fertilization, where eggs are released into the water for external fertilization by sperm. In both cases, the development of the young often involves a larval stage that lives in the plankton for a period before metamorphosing into a juvenile and settling on the seafloor.\n\nIn summary, the reproductive characteristics of Vestigastropoda involve reduced body forms, low sexual dimorphism, and a variety of reproductive strategies, often involving a larval phase in the water column."

He was born in Chongqing, Sichuan Province, his ancestors having moved there from Meizhou, Guangdong area. Zou was sent to Japan at an early age, where he studied and observed Japanese modernization.\nWhen he returned to China, he started to write essays on how to free the Chinese nation from the Manchu regime and foreign imperialism. In 1903, he published a  book on this topic: The Revolutionary Army (; Gmng Jn). The deeply patriotic book, informed by Republicanism and Social Darwinist racial theories, was widely read and had a profound influence on the revolutionary movement. Thousands of copies of the book were distributed internationally by Sun Yat-sen in support of the revolutionary cause.\nZou found the Qing government unable to deal with the contemporary crisis of colonization, weakness and corruption. For Zou, the Manchu were the source of China's inability to overcome traditional obstacles for modern reforms and he analyzed their mistakes and weaknesses point by point. Moreover, he condemned China's traditional monarchical system, which had made the Han Chinese \"slaves\" rather than \"citizens.\" He was also influenced by racialist Han ideology, as evidenced in his distaste for the Manchu governing class, as he advocated genocide [of] the five million and more of the furry and horned Manchu race, cleansing ourselves of 260 years of harsh and unremitting pain, so that the soil of the Chinese subcontinent is made immaculate, and the descendants of the Yellow Emperor will all become Washingtons.\nHis calls for sovereignty of the Chinese people included the establishment of a parliament, equal rights for women, freedom of speech and freedom of the press. These seemingly liberal ideals were underpinned by a potentially genocidal ethnic nationalism; it was not the liberty of the individual, but the sovereignty of the ethnic nation-state (\"A man cannot live without his country\") that formed the foundations for the Republic of China as envisioned by Zou Rong.\nZou lived in a foreign concession in Shanghai where he enjoyed extraterritorial rights and could not be sentenced to death by a Qing Court. Instead, he was closely associated with Zhang Binglin and implicated in the Su Bao incident as a result, which rendered him a prison sentence of two years; he fell ill while incarcerated and died in April 1905 at the age of 20.",

She is a four-time Olympic Champion and three-time Overall World Champion for 19951997. She was a dominant force in International Short Track Speed Skating during the mid-1990s.\nChun took part in the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France, at the age of 15, but failed to win much attention. In 1994, however, Chun won two gold medals at the Lillehammer Winter Olympic Games. She won the women's 1000 m final, defeating the reigning World Champion Nathalie Lambert and former World Champion Kim So-hee, and was part of the team that won the 3000 m relay in a world record time along with Kim.\nBetween 1994 and 1998 Winter Olympics, Chun won the Overall World Championship three times in a row, in 1995, 1996 and 1997 (becoming the second person to have won three consecutive Overall World Championships).  She shared the 1997 title though with Yang Yang (A), her most significant career rival.   She also won the Overall World Cup title for 19971998 season.\nIn 1998, at the Nagano Winter Olympics, Chun successfully defended both of her Olympic titles, by defeating China's Yang Yang (A) and Yang Yang (S) in the 1000 m final after trailing for most of the race.   Yang Yang (A) crossed the line together with Chun in what was ruled and reviewed as a photo finish, but was then disqualified for cross tracking Chun at the very end as Chun tried to pass on the inside (although the photo finish seemed to show Chun having defeated her for the gold regardless). She led the relay team to another Olympic victory with world record time, completing the first \"double-double\" in Olympic short track history.   She also added a 5th Olympic medal, a surprising bronze in the 500 metres, her weakest event and which she had never won a World Championship medal in.   She was advanced to the bronze after winning the B final, due to a major fall in the A final leading to the disqualification of Isabelle Charest, and the refusal to finish of Wang Chunlu.   She became the first quadruple Olympic Champion in Short Track Speed Skating and the first one from Korea.  One month later at the 1998 World Championships, her final major international meet, Chun won 4 medals including her 3rd title at 3000 metres, but was still narrowly denied a 4th consecutive Overall World Championship by Yang Yang (A) (the 2nd of Yang Yang (A)'s own 6 consecutive titles, after having tied Chun for the 97 title).  The key event to the final overall result was the 1000 metres, where just as in Nagano Chun and Yang Yang (A) crossed in a virtual dead heat over the distance, but this time with Yang emerging the victor and getting the crucial 1st place points to the overall title with it.   This provided the final chapter to the intense rivalry of the 2 all-time greats, as Chun would retire immediately after the meet.\nIn 2002, Chun was elected to the Athletes' Committee of the International Olympic Committee.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "summary": "Euphorbia duranii, being endemic to Madagascar, highlights the island's unique biodiversity and ecological significance. Endemism indicates that species evolve in isolation and may have specific roles within their ecosystems. The presence of such species is indicative of healthy ecosystems and contributes to the overall ecological balance. However, endemic species are often more vulnerable to extinction, especially under threats like habitat loss. The loss of Euphorbia duranii could have cascading effects on its ecosystem, potentially affecting other species that rely on it for habitat or as part of the food web. Therefore, understanding and preserving the ecological niches of endemic species like Euphorbia duranii is crucial for maintaining biodiversity and ecological integrity in Madagascar."

    "summary": "Classifying Euphorbia duranii as endemic to Madagascar could have implications for biodiversity and ecological balance. This species is known for its wide range of ecological adaptations, including the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through the production of enzymes. As a result, the removal of this species from Madagascar could have negative consequences for the local ecosystem, potentially leading to a decrease in nitrogen fixation and a decline in plant species diversity. This could in turn affect local communities that rely on these resources for their livelihoods. Therefore, it is important to consider the potential ecological and socioeconomic implications before making any decisions regarding the classification of this species."

The Sokolsky District is one of the administrative districts in Vologda Oblast, which is an important administrative region in Russia. Being part of these divisions means that Tupitsyno is subject to local governance structures and policies determined by both the district and the broader regional authority. This can affect aspects like resource allocation, infrastructure development, and local economic initiatives. Moreover, the rank of a rural locality in a larger administrative framework can influence population trends, as smaller rural areas may face challenges such as urban migration, leading to even smaller populations over time.

This suggests that the historical validity of Terpsion's life, character, and contributions is limited, as later sources do not provide independent verification or substantial additional detail about him. Essentially, Terpsion's legacy in historical philosophical discourse heavily relies on the narrative constructed by Plato, indicating that most of what we know of him originates from these specific contexts and is not supported by separate historical accounts."

    "summary": "The television series The Walking Dead follows a different narrative path than its comic book counterpart. While the comic books were written by Robert Kirkman until their final issue in 2019, the television series has its own distinct storylines, following its own continuity. In the comics, The Walking Dead is not a simple question of good or bad characters; rather, the characters are a product of a changing environment they struggle to survive in. In contrast, the television series maintains a focus on the characters' struggles and emotional journeys. Additionally, there are differences between the two in terms of plot and characterization, reflecting the different mediums and creative processes of each."
